This is paper would be interactive and fully open-access. My handwriting manuscript is prepared, but I need time to craft it into a rigorous research treatize. 

## Abstract 

Motivated by Shannon-Weaver model and recent rehabiliation of self-supervised artificial intelligence having a "World Model", this paper propose an **unified intelligence-communication (UIC) model** for describing a single agent and any multi-agent system. 
The model try to incorporates the following contributions.
+ The environment is modelled as the generic communication channel between agents. 
+ The model leads to important insights on that "Any intelligent structure is an aggregation of multiple agents", where the simplest or basic unit of a agent is represented by "IF-THEN" rule**, as proposed by Holland and Marvinminsky.
+ The model unifies several well-adopted agent architecture, e.g. Observe-Orient-Decide-Act (OODA) model, world-model based agent model and rule-based agent model, and provides information theory societies **a common model for practicing quantitative analytical methods**.
+ The model provides an unified approach to investigate a multi-agent system (MAS) having multiple action-perception modalities, e.g. explicitly information transfer and implicit information transfer.

Then, the paper provide case studies, exemplifying the adoption of the UIC model, 
+ Analysis of natural MAS, e.g. a bee-colony
+ Design of artificial MAS, e.g. co-design of communication-perception-action in multi-robot system

Finally, the paper provides further insights motivated by the UIC model, such as:
+ Unification of single intelligence and collective intelligence
+ An possible explanation of intelligence emergence
+ A dual model for agent-environment intelligence hypothesis
