This paper would be fully open-access. My handwriting manuscript is prepared, but I need time to craft it into a rigorous research treatize. 

This Chapter introduces 

Further insights of the UIC model, as proposed in the outline of this paper, would be discussed in depth in the following-up Chapters. 

## A Brief Review of the Agent Internal Models

## Modelling Information Source and Destination: Is World Model a Good Abstraction?

### The Temporal and Spatial Structure of the World Model

### The Recursive Structure of the World Model

More Details would be Explained in Chapter Seven: Hypothesis of UIC Model for Explaining Intelligence Emergence Mechanism.
